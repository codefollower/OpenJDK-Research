# This test tests the actual swap size on linux and solaris.
# On windows this is just a sanity check and correct size should
# be checked manually:
#
# Windows NT/XP/2000:
#   1. Run Start->Accessories->System Tools->System Information.
#   2. The value (reported in Kbytes) is in the "Page File Space" entry
# Windows 98/ME:
#   Unknown.
